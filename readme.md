This will be a system analyzer tool. We need to take a look at existing systems. use relevant information like running processes, types of applications running and files being processed. we will use GitLab repo scanning and harbor access to infer things about the server. as well as vcenter access or proxmox access. also use bash historys via sudo su to look for relevant system setup commands in user histories. Once we have a complete idea of what a system does, we want to create a document describing what the server does in detail with possible trouble shooting ideas for programs running. We also want to generate terraform,ansible,packer to recreate the system using a new vsphere template.
